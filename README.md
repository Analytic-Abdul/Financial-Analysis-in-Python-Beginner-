# Financial-Analysis-in-Python - Beginner Project

## About this project

This project showcases my analytics skills, understanding of financial statements and my ability to manipulate python and it's libraries to extract insights from data. The data of Fortune 500 companies used in this project was provided in a data Datacamp Real World Project.

In this project I'll "Help our hedge fund manager!" compare data about Fortune 500 companies by collecting, preparing, cleaning, analysing and visualizing this data about financial statements.

## Prerequisites

There are 2 datasets in this project stored in data folder, the first is the Balance Sheet, the second is the Income Statement.
Both datasets are in xlsx format so we need to pip install the openpyxl module "pip install openpyxl" to read the data.

## Project steps

1. Import the necessary libraries and load the data.
2. Visualize the total revenue for each company by year.
3. Visualize the total revenue for each industry by year.
4. Visualize the distribution of revenue across the companies.
5. Visualize the distribution of revenue across the industries.
6. Calculate the profit margin for each company.
7. Visualize the profit margin across different industry sectors.

## Analysis Questions

1. What is the distribution of revenue across these companies?
2. How does profit margin vary across different industry sectors?
3. Which companies have shown the most significant revenue growth over the reported period?
4. Is there a correlation between company size (by revenue) and profitability?
5. What are the top 10 most profitable companies in the dataset?
6. How do debt levels compare across different companies and sectors?
7. Which companies have the highest and lowest operating expenses?
8. Is there a relationship between research & development spending and profit margins?
9. How do companies compare in terms of return on assets (ROA)?
10. What is the average employee productivity (revenue per employee) across different sectors?

These questions will guide our analysis to help the hedge fund manager make data-driven investment decisions.

## What is Financial Analysis?

Financial analysis is the process of examining a company's financial statements and other financial data to assess its financial health, performance, and prospects. It involves analyzing key financial ratios, trends, and metrics to understand the company's financial position, profitability, liquidity, and solvency. Financial analysis is used by investors, creditors, analysts, and other stakeholders to make informed investment, lending, and business decisions.

## What are financial statements?

Financial statements are formal records of a company's financial activities and position. They provide a comprehensive overview of a company's financial performance, position, and cash flows over a specific period. Financial statements are essential for stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and management, to make informed decisions about the company's financial health and prospects.
